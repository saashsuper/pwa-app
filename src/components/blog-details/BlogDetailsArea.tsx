							One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
							himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little
							he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches
							into stiff sections.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide
							off any moment.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest
							of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. Whats happened to
							me?  he thought.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							It wasnt a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little
							too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
							Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
							picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine
							and housed in a nice, gilded frame.
						</p>
						<p className="fz-14">
							It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
							upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her
							lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the
							window at the dull weather.
